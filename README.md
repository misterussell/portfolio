# Basic Portfolio SPA
- This project was created as a way to centralize key projects quickly and cleanly without having to rely on overly complicated templates
- I will be utilizing this smaller project to build experience with React transitions

## Features
- This is a relatively quick build that can act as a minimal portfolio

## Use
- Files can updated with relevant key/property data in the main [projects data file](https://github.com/misterussell/portfolio/blob/master/app/scripts/data/projects.js)

## Dependencies
- `react`, `react-router`
- `TIY build tool` [documentation](https://github.com/TIY-Austin-Front-End-Engineering/spa-scaffold)
- `sass` [install guide here](http://sass-lang.com/install)
